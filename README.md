# Keystone Generator

A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com), the model-driven cms for node.js built on Express and MongoDB.

`yo keystone` will scaffold a new KeystoneJS project for you, and offer to set up blog, gallery, and enquiry (contact form) models + views.

## Fork info

Includes option to use Dust templating engine

## Getting Started

First up, you'll need Node.js >= 0.10.x and MongoDB >= 2.4.x installed. If you don't have them, follow the **Dependencies** instructions below.

Then, install the Keystone generator:

````
$ npm install -g generator-keystone
````

If you see errors, check the [problems](#err-please-try-running-this-command-again-as-rootadministrator) section below.

With the generator installed, create an empty directory for your new KeystoneJS Project, and run `yo keystone` in it:

````
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ yo keystone
````

The generator will ask you a few questions about which features to include, then prompt you for Cloudinary and Mandrill account details.

**These accounts are optional**, but Cloudinary is used to host the images for the blog and gallery templates. You can get a free account for each at:

* [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) - Image serving and management in the cloud
* [Mandrill](https://mandrill.com/signup/) - Transactional email service by [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com)

### What next?

When you've got your new project, check out the [KeystoneJS Documentation](http://keystonejs.com/docs) to learn more about how to get started with KeystoneJS.

## Problems?

### ERR! Please try running this command again as root/Administrator.

When running `npm install -g generator-keystone`, you may get an **EACCES** error asking you to run the command again as root/Administrator. This indicates that there is a permissions issue.

On your development system you can change directory ownership to the current $USER so you do not have to run `sudo` while installing untrusted code:

````
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local

# Other directories may be required depending on your O/S
sudo chown -R $USER /usr/lib/node_modules/
````

For a production/shared environment you may wish to re-run the `npm` command with the `sudo` prefix:

````
sudo npm install -g generator-keystone
````

For more information, see the ["What, no sudo?"](http://foohack.com/2010/08/intro-to-npm/#what_no_sudo) of the Intro to npm by Isaac Schlueter.

### What do you mean it couldn't find my Database?

By default, KeystoneJS will look for a MongoDB server running on `localhost` on the default port, and connect to it. If you're getting errors related to the MongoDB connection, make sure your MongoDB server is running.

If you haven't installed MongoDB yet, follow the instructions below.

To connect to a server **other** than `localhost`, add a `MONGO_URI` setting to the `.env` file in your Keystone project directory:

````
MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-server/database-name
````


## Dependencies

### Install Node.js

Download and install the node.js binaries for your platform from the [Node.js download page](http://nodejs.org/download/).

### Install MongoDB

If you're on a mac, the easiest way to install MongoDB is to use the [homebrew package manager for OS X](http://brew.sh/). To install it, run this in your terminal:

````
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
````

With Homebrew installed, run this in your terminal to download and install MongoDB:

````
brew install mongodb
````

This may generate a warning message

'Warning: You have not agreed to the Xcode license.  Builds will fail! Agree to the license by opening Xcode.app or running: xcodebuild -license.'  If you see this message, run:

````
sudo xcodebuild -license
````

Hit 'enter' if prompted to view and agree to the licenses, navigate to the bottom using the 'space' key, then type 'agree' before attempting the install command again.

For other platforms, see the [MongoDB installation guides](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).
